Hello! 

Made this game during "Imers√£o Alura", at the second lesson. There's some changes in relation to the original code: now you can use the button "cancel" of the window prompt, there's a limited number of attempts and you don't need to reload the page to play again.

Added a button to play and I've also tried to made an interface to the page with HTML and CSS.
